Project 01 - TIC TAC TOE
========================

Link to play the game: [Project 01 - Tic Tac Toe](https://branyflores.github.io/TIC-TAC-TOE-Project/)

Project Purpose
--------------------------

Project 01 is my very first project, builded using JavaScript and Css for styling. 
In this first project I not only learned a lot about creating features using JavaScript, but also I was able to develop my creativity  using style css.

-----------------------------
### Skills Tested
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- DOM manipulation

Bugs to Fix
===========================

- need to implement the feature to inform each player's turn on the screen.
- also needs to inform the winner after the end of the game. 

Design Inspiration
--------------------------

 My inspiration was in something modern and clean at the same time, but that could bring a bit of my personality.
 This is why i used a transparent background for the game board, but a background with some coulor.
