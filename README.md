This is a basic simple version of Tic Tac Toe, that i created for my First Projects for SEIR COURSE, CLASS 52.

Game functions 

> 2 players ('x') and ('o)
> returns a winer
> reset the game once we have a winer
>tie game === (i am still working on that)

Bugs

still need to implement a media query for different screens size and the fuction "Tie Game".

I also want to work more on the style of the game such as change the font type.
